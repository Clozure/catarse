<br>

         The terms of use have the "General Conditions applicable to the use of the online platform provided by COMMON GROUP consulting and BUSINESS BROKERAGE LTDA-ME, limited liability company, registered in the CNPJ under paragraph 14,512,425/0001-94, with the Street address Itapeva, 220, 42, hereinafter referred to as" CATARSE"'
        guidelines: "Definitions"

          PROJECT CREATOR: is the CATARSE user interested in raising funds for realization of a creative project.<br>

          SUPPORTER: is the CATARSE user interested in contributing financially to the PROJECTS of one or more CREATORS OF PROJECTS, who may receive rewards in accordance with the rules set out in each project.<br>

        PROJECT: is a creative project released in the CATARSE platform by a PROJECT CREATOR with the goal of raising funds for its implementation. For each project, rewards or incentives shall be defined for supporters, according to the rules defined in each project. The projects must follow the guidelines for creating designs, and any project that is not in accordance with such guidelines, may be removed from the platform by CATARSE.<br>

        SUCCESSFUL PROJECT: is a project that reaches or surpasses the value claimed within determined by the PROJECT CREATOR.<br>

        how_works: "What is Catarse and how does it work"
        how_works_text: 'CATARSE is an online platform that is intended to support PROJECT CREATORS and SUPPORTERS, with the goal of collectively raising funds ("crowd funding"), to implement projects. CATARSE allows a PROJECT CREATOR to submit a project idea and raise funds from SUPPORTERS interested in contributing to the project. PROJECT CREATORS will also offer SUPPORTERS rewards, which will be defined in each project. CATARSE collects the amounts paid by SUPPORTERS until the deadline determined by the PROJECT CREATORS.<br>


	  When one of these projects is successful, reaching or exceeding the prescribed amount for its feasibility, within the time limit set in the project, the total amount raised from SUPPORTERS is passed on to the PROJECT CREATOR, discounted by the percentage due to the CATARSE. On the other hand, if a project is not successful, failing to reach the amount requested, the CATARSE will arrange the REFUND of the amounts paid. To the amounts paid by credit card, the refund will be accomplished in the next Bill or invoice for the credit card. If however, the payment was made by bank transfer, the refund will be accomplished through deposit to the bank account indicated by the SUPPORTER, so requested by CATARSE. If the bank account for reimbursement is not provided, the CATARSE will keep the values available for reimbursement for a maximum term of 12 months, as detailed in "Fees and Payments" below.<br>


	  CATARSE aims only to support PROJECT CREATORS and SUPPORTERS through its online platform. The use of CATARSE does not constitute an employment relationship, association or society between any USERS (SUPPORTERS and PROJECT CREATORS) and CATARSE, nor is it a commercial transaction or sale of products or services.

	  CATARSE is responsible for the maintenance of your website. However, CATARSE not guarantee that PROJECTS will complete, nor that the incentives/rewards offered by PROJECT CREATORS will be honored.<br>

	  It is the sole and exclusive responsibility of the PROJECT CREATORS to complete proposed PROJECTS and to deliver any promised rewards or compensation for any damage experienced by SUPPORTERS, arising from acts or omissions of PROJECT CREATORS.<br>

        tax: "Fees and Payments"
        tax_text: "The SUPPORTER and the PROJECT CREATOR are fully aware and agree that all amounts allocated to support projects can only be collected by credit card or bank transfer, (at the SUPPORTER option), being deposited in the ownership account of CATARSE. There are two possibilities:<br/>

If the PROJECT is SUCCESSFUL, the total amount collected for the PROJECT (even if higher than the amount originally requested by the PROJECT CREATOR) will be transferred by CATARSE to an entitlement account of the PROJECT CREATOR, discounting this figure by 13% (thirteen percent), which includes the CATARSE intermediation fee and the fees charged by means of payment.<br/>

If the PROJECT is NOT SUCCESSFUL, the SUPPORTERS who have paid SUPPORT by credit card will automatically receive a REFUND of the amount originally offered to the PROJECT, in bill or invoice subsequent to the termination of the PROJECT.  SUPPORTERS who have paid by bank transfer will be informed by CATARSE that the PROJECT was not successful and should provide bank account information so that a REFUND can be performed. CATARSE points out that in this case the REFUND can not be done automatically, since at the time of payment, bank details of SUPPORTERS who pay via bank transfer are not requested.<br/>

SUPPORTERS should be aware that if you do not provide your bank details when informed by CATARSE when the supported PROJECT was not successful, you will not receive a REFUND. In this case, as a service, CATARSE will make your money available for redemption for 12 months from the closing date of the PROJECT. After this period, the amounts in question shall be deemed waived and may be used by CATARSE to support other projects for funding on the platform.<br/> 

Unless otherwise specified, all rates are quoted in Reais (R$). The USER is responsible for paying all fees and taxes associated with the use of CATARSE, including, but not limited to the CATARSE brokerage fee and charges or tariffs for the means of payment, as well as any taxes or taxes levied on the PROJECT or on the agreemen between the SUPPORTER and PROJECT CREATOR. If a PROJECT is removed from CATARSE for violating these Terms of Use, violation of law or by court order, the amounts paid by SUPPORTERS cannot be reimbursed if the supporter, having knowledge of such violation, has not notified CATHARSIS by email to contato@catarse.me.<br/>

Given that banking accounts and credit cards are independent of CATARSE, their owners have exclusive responsibility for processing payments and for failures in the use of their means of payment.
